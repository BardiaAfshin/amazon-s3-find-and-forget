# User Guide

This section describes how to install, configure and use the Amazon S3 Find and
Forget solution.

## Deploying the Solution

To deploy the sample application you will require an AWS account. If you
donâ€™t already have an AWS account, create one at <https://aws.amazon.com> by
following the on-screen instructions. Your access to the AWS account must have
IAM permissions to launch AWS CloudFormation templates that create IAM roles and
to create the solution resources.

The demo application is deployed as an
[AWS CloudFormation](https://aws.amazon.com/cloudformation) template.

> **Note** You are responsible for the cost of the AWS services used while
> running this solution. For full details, see the pricing pages for each AWS
> service you will be using in this sample. Prices are subject to change.

2. If prompted, login using your AWS account credentials.
3. You should see a screen titled "*Create Stack*" at the "*Specify template*"
   step. The fields specifying the CloudFormation template are pre-populated.
   Click the *Next* button at the bottom of the page.
4. On the "*Specify stack details*" screen you may customize the following
   parameters of the CloudFormation stack:
   * **Stack Name:** (Default: S3F2) This is the name that is used to refer to
   this stack in CloudFormation once deployed.
   * **AdminEmail:** The email address you wish to setup as the initial
   user of this Amazon S3 Find and Forget deployment

   When completed, click *Next*
5. [Configure stack options](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/AWSCloudFormation/latest/UserGuide/cfn-console-add-tags.html) if desired, then click *Next*.
6. On the review you screen, you must check the boxes for:
   * "*I acknowledge that AWS CloudFormation might create IAM resources*" 
   * "*I acknowledge that AWS CloudFormation might create IAM resources
   with custom names*" 

   These are required to allow CloudFormation to create a Role to allow access
   to resources needed by the stack and name the resources in a dynamic way.
7. Click *Create Change Set* 
8. On the *Change Set* screen, click *Execute* to launch your stack.
   * You may need to wait for the *Execution status* of the change set to
   become "*AVAILABLE*" before the "*Execute*" button becomes available.
9. Wait for the CloudFormation stack to launch. Completion is indicated when
   the "Stack status" is "*CREATE_COMPLETE*".
   * You can monitor the stack creation progress in the "Events" tab.
10. Note the *url* displayed in the *Outputs* tab for the stack. This is used
   to access the application.
